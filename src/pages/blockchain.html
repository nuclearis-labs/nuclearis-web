        <p>International entities that introduce new regulations for the construction of Nuclear Power Plants are
            constantly migrating their document management systems towards digital technology which provides a greater
            degree of reliability. Imagine, for example, the possibility to store all the traceability information of
            the production processes involved in the millions of mechanical components that make up a Reactor forever.
            This technology already exists, it is called: Blockchain. Blockchain which refers to “a chain of blocks"
            consists of a set of digital technologies that allow us to keep a secure, decentralized, synchronized and
            distributed record of certain digital information. Blockchain is a database that uses cryptography to
            provide maximum immutability and reliability when storing information.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>As a result, the world's major regulators are beginning to see Blockchain technology as the
                        natural evolution in the task of providing reliability to an industrial activity as sensitive
                        and critical as nuclear energy. Let’s take the most recognized worldwide association in the
                        development of nuclear regulations the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) as an
                        example. ASME has already begun to make some publications on the potential advantages of
                        Blockchain technology applied to the nuclear field. You can visit their <a
                            href="https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/the-chain-gang"

                    <p>Innovation introduced by NUCLEARIS
                        In October 2020, after 4 years of intense work for our specialized team of programmers,
                        <b>NUCLEARIS became the first company worldwide to implement Blockchain technology to monitor
                            its production process information and to store traceability-related data.</b>
                        Today, the manufacturing process information of the hundreds of highly critical mechanical parts
                        in the core of Atucha I & II Nuclear Power Plants is perpetually stored in the Blockchain. To
                        better understand the attributes of this technology, we must first observe how the current
                        methodology for recording information in the nuclear industry works. Nowadays, it is necessary
                        to create documents and records in each of the stages of the production process- the extraction
                        of minerals, the smelting of metals, steel refining, heat treatments, machining, welding,
                        surface coatings, and so on. Engineers around the world are required to upload information in
                        pre-established forms with quantitative and qualitative data on each of the processes involved
                        in the manufacture of mechanical parts destined to be installed in a Nuclear Reactor. These
                        forms are then printed and attached to a folder that accompanies the raw materials, materials,
                        semi-finished and finished products at all times along the way. This hard copy of the
                        documentation must then be delivered with the mechanical components and the Nuclear Power Plant
                        managers must store it for the entire life of the Reactor, that is, for several decades. It
                        should be noted that the production process of a nuclear-mechanical component, from mining to
                        the finished product, can take several months, even years. Transporting papers together with the
                        mechanical components may seem an "unsafe" methodology, however, this is how the traceability of
                        mechanical components is carried out in the nuclear industry worldwide and how international
                        regulations require it to be done.
                    </p>
                    <p>What NUCLEARIS has achieved represents a disruption in the nuclear industry by making the “paper”
                        methodology obsolete. We have accomplished this task by developing a software platform based on
                        Blockchain to save the data on the manufacturing processes in an immutable way thanks to the
                        creation of a cryptographic hash attached exclusively to a specific file. The hash, created
                        using encryption algorithms, is like a “fingerprint” of the documentation stored. Moreover, it
                        allows us to save the data perpetually in a way in which it can neither be altered nor tampered
                        with. Immutability is an inherent virtue of Blockchain technology.</p>
                    <p>In the nuclear industry, traceability really “means everything”. Nuclearis’ project can be
                        defined as a decentralized database and an encrypted storage system in which the manufacturers
                        of the different mechanical components in the world save their documentation while the processes
                        are taking place. Let’s now imagine a world in which NUCLEARCHAIN exists: all the activities
                        related to manufacturing nuclear mechanical components in the world are registered on the same
                        blockchain. That will represent the biggest revolution in trust in our industry.</p>

            <p>In October 2020, after 3 years of continuous work, we launched NUCLEARISTRACK , a traceability
                platform for the manufacturing of mechanical components to be installed in a Nuclear Power Plant. We
                used intelligent contracts in RSK blockchain to develop this project. Thanks to this development, we
                became the first company in the world to produce a batch of mechanical parts using Blockchain
                authentication. These components have been since installed in the core of two working nuclear
                reactors, Atucha I and II.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>To better understand the attributes of this technology, we must first observe how the
                            current methodology for recording information in the nuclear industry works. Nowadays,
                            it is necessary to create documents and records in each of the stages of the production
                            process- the extraction of minerals, the smelting of metals, steel refining, heat
                            treatments, machining, welding, surface coatings, and so on. Engineers around the world
                            are required to upload information in pre-established forms with quantitative and
                            qualitative data on each of the processes involved in the manufacture of mechanical
                            parts destined to be installed in a Nuclear Reactor. These forms are then printed and
                            attached to a folder that accompanies the raw materials, materials, semi-finished and
                            finished products at all times along the way. This hard copy of the documentation must
                            then be delivered with the mechanical components and the Nuclear Power Plant managers
                            must store it for the entire life of the Reactor, that is, for several decades. It
                            should be noted that the production process of a nuclear-mechanical component, from
                            mining to the finished product, can take several months, even years. Transporting papers
                            together with the mechanical components may seem an "unsafe" methodology, however, this
                            is how the traceability of mechanical components is carried out in the nuclear industry
                            worldwide and how international regulations require it to be done. What NUCLEARIS has
                            achieved represents a disruption in the nuclear industry by making the “paper”
                            methodology obsolete. We have accomplished this task by developing a software platform
                            based on Blockchain to save the data on the manufacturing processes in an immutable way
                            thanks to the creation of a cryptographic hash attached exclusively to a specific file.
                            The hash, created using encryption algorithms, is like a “fingerprint” of the
                            documentation stored. Moreover, it allows us to save the data perpetually in a way in
                            which it can neither be altered nor tampered with. Immutability is an inherent virtue of
                            Blockchain technology. In the nuclear industry, traceability really “means everything”.
                            Nuclearis’ project can be defined as a decentralized database and an encrypted storage
                            system in which the manufacturers of the different mechanical components in the world
                            save their documentation while the processes are taking place. Let’s now imagine a world
                            in which NUCLEARCHAIN exists: all the activities related to manufacturing nuclear
                            mechanical components in the world are registered on the same blockchain. That will
                            represent the biggest revolution in trust in our industry.</p>

                MATTERIA is a management system for documents that are hashed in a Blockchain developed by NUCLEARIS
                using Polkadot protocol. This software technology adds the highest level of security and
                immutability to the documents of each manufacturing process of the mechanical components to be
                installed in a Nuclear Power Plant under the American regulation ASME (American Society of

                DOSETRACK. This new digital system invented by NUCLEARIS consists of a mobile application that uses
                a Blockchain database to register the doses absorbed by the workers who manipulate radioactive
                sources in the Nuclear Industry. This system records the dose level of Gamma radiation from
                dosimeters carried by operators of nuclear power plants and other nuclear facilities. The
                information is saved on immutable ledgers that allow monitoring of radiation levels in order to
